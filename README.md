# CodeMate – Python Coding & Debugging Agent

CodeMate is a desktop-based Python coding assistant designed to help developers
debug errors, understand tracebacks, analyze code quality, suggest refactors,
and generate unit test templates — all in a clean, IDE-like environment.

The tool is built using Python’s standard library and provides both a
command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).
